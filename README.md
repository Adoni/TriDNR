# TriDNR
Tri-Party Deep Network Representation

The codes implement the TriDNR algorithm, which learns an continuous representation for each node in a network. TriDNR uses information from three perspectives, including node structure, node content, and node labels (if available), to jointly learn optimal node representation


The code is developed in Python, based on the package gensim, and DeepWalk. All required packages are defined in requirements.txt. To install all requirement, simply use the following commands:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

A demo is provide in 'demo.py', which runs and compares several algorithms
